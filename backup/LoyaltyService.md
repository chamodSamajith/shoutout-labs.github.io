#### User Registration

 1. Merchant submit the customer details to loyalty service using one of the following
 - Hosted registration form

 - Direct API call
 2. Optionally customer receives a SMS or an Email with a welcome message and details of his/her loyalty account

4. Optionally a SMS or an Email is sent to the customer with the details of the transaction and points accumulation.

### <a id="#rA"></a>RESTful API

We have a very simple RESTful API with mainly four endpoints. And all endpoints receives request data as JSON objects.

 1. Register Users
 2. Load User
 3. Collect Points
 4. Redeem Points

#### <a id="#1"></a>Register Users

This is a merchant specific endpoint and would be created upon request based on the merchant specific parameters

#### <a id="#2"></a>Load User

Each user has its own URL

```
